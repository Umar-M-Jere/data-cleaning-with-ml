# Sales Data Analysis Mini Project

This project showcases my recent experience in advanced data cleaning techniques, developed as part of my ongoing journey in the Data Science track of 3MTT.

## Overview
Traditionally, data cleaning involved removing missing values or filling them with methods like `fillna()`. However, inspired by my latest learning, I explored how machine learning models can predict missing values based on data patterns.

During this project:

- I closely analyzed the dataset and identified a clear pattern in the missing data.
- Recognizing the potential for machine learning-based imputation, I implemented models to predict and fill these missing values.
- This approach enhanced data quality and provided more reliable insights.

## Key Highlights
- Gained insights into advanced data imputation techniques using machine learning
- Applied pattern recognition in missing data to guide imputation strategies
- Reinforced practical understanding of machine learning in real-world data cleaning

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.) are installed.
2. Open the notebook file (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
3. Follow the steps within the notebook to rerun the analysis.
